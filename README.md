## How It Works
Each timer starts after the first time you complete a trial quest and received the corresponding loot per character.

## Commands
### /twrte
Display trial timers for all your characters.

### /twrtedebug
Toggle debug mode. When in debug mode, all looted items and completed quests will be logged in chat with their ID.
